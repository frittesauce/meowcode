this is my first try on making a compiler named fiskur for a codding language im making named kitty (.kty as file extention)

# to run
download this repo and start of with running 
`cargo build`
in your terminal to make the first exe, create a path variable towards its default build location for ease of use,

inside this project is already a fiskur/kitty project but you can make a new one in any folder with the command
`fiskur new (project name)`

after you have a project the compiler will always look for a folder named main.kty inside the src folder so thats where you write your test code
to try the compiler do 
`fiskur build`
inside a valid project folder
